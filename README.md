# UCLA-CS174A

These are my solutions to the projects from CS 174A Introduction to Computer Graphics taught by Professor Asish Law in Spring 2020. 

## Basketball Shooter
For my final project in this course, my team and I decided to create a simple basketball shooting game, which would utlize 
mouse picking, physics, and collision detection. Due to time constraints, we were unable to fully implement a backboard and
hoop, so we modified the game to shooting at a target on the wall.
