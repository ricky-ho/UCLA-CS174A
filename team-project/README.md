## Group Members:
Brian Le, Logan Hernandez, Ricky Ho

## Our Project:
Our project is a simple basketball shooting game in which a player has 2 minutes to score as many points as possible by hitting a target on the wall. 

## How to run:
1. Clone or download our project into your local machine.
2. If you are running on Windows, run the file called "host.bat". If you are running on Mac, run the file called "host.command". This should
   open your command prompt to run a python command to create a server at port #### (this is usually port 8000).
3. Open up your chrome browser and enter in the url: localhost:#### (e.g. localhost:8000)
4. You should now be able to see the game and play!

## How to play:
To play the game, the user controls the ball's movement and trajectory using their mouse cursor. Click and hold to move the ball around and release
to throw the ball. The velocity of the ball depends on the speed and direction in which the player drags and releases their mouse. The goal of the game 
is to hit as many targets to score as many points as possible within the time limit. When the timer ends, the player can simply continue playing by
clicking on the screen again which will automatically restart the timer.
